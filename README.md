# Advent of Code 2022 Personal Solutions

This repository contains my personal solutions to the Advent of Code challenge for 2022 (https://adventofcode.com/2022). They will be written first in TypeScript with Node.js, then again in Rust as a personal learning exercise.

I'm doing this for my own entertainment and education, and I don't make any claims regarding the efficiency of my solutions. However, I do ensure that they do produce the correct result given the input data provided to me.
